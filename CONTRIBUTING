GaMA is an open source project. Pull requests, questions, feature requests, or bug reports via issues are all welcome. Questions should be sent to pearl3@llnl.gov.

To contribute, you should create a fork. This will create your copy of the GaMA repository and ensure you can push your changes up to GitHub and create PRs.

 - Create your branches off the repo:main branch.
 - Clearly name your branches, commits, and PRs as this will help us manage queued work in a timely manner.
 - Articulate your commit messages in the imperative (e.g., Adds new privacy policy link to README).
 - Commit your work in logically organized commits, and group commits together logically in a PR.
 - Title each PR clearly and give it an unambiguous description.
 - Review existing issues before opening a new one. Your issue might already be under development or discussed by others. Feel free to add to any outstanding issue/bug.
 - Be explicit when opening issues and reporting bugs. What behavior are you expecting? What is your justification or use case for the new feature/enhancement? How can the bug be recreated? What are any environment variables to consider?
